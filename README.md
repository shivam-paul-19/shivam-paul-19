### *About me*

I'm currently pursuing my BCA (bachelor of Computer application) from Vivekananda Instutute of proffesional studies. Having a good command of programming fundamentals and a strong interest in the field of web development, I have a good knowledge and proficiency in the MERN stack and also made projects on them which you can check it through my repositories.

Other than web development, I'm too learning the amazing world of data science and machine learning. My main goal is to always make me better than what I was yesterday, and in the long run I see myself being enough knowledgable and skillful to contribute in the field of Information technologies.
